# Diabetic-Retinopathy
DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY FROM FUNDUS IMAGES USING SVM, KNN, and attention-based CNN models with GradCam score for interpretability

Detecting diabetic retinopathy using a Keras model involves leveraging the power of deep learning to analyze retinal images and identify signs of the disease. Keras is a popular high-level deep learning framework that provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for building and training neural networks. Here's an overview of how you can implement a diabetic retinopathy detection system using Keras:

Dataset preparation: Gather a dataset of retinal images, labeled with the corresponding diabetic retinopathy severity levels. Ensure that the dataset is well-balanced, representative, and diverse to avoid biased model predictions.

Data preprocessing: Preprocess the retinal images to prepare them for training the Keras model. This step may involve resizing the images to a uniform size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset by applying transformations such as rotations, flips, or zooms to increase variability.

Model architecture: Design the architecture of the Keras model for diabetic retinopathy detection. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are particularly effective in image classification tasks. You can choose from various CNN architectures like VGG, ResNet, Inception, or design your own custom architecture. The model should have multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to capture relevant features from the retinal images. Fully connected layers can be added at the end to perform classification.

Model compilation: Compile the Keras model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics. For binary classification (presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy), binary cross-entropy is commonly used as the loss function. The choice of optimizer depends on your preference, with popular options being Adam, RMSprop, or SGD. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be specified to monitor the model's performance during training.

Model training: Split the preprocessed dataset into training and validation sets. Use the training set to train the Keras model by feeding the retinal images along with their corresponding labels. Adjust the model's parameters through backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the loss function. The validation set helps monitor the model's performance and avoid overfitting. Experiment with hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to find the best configuration.

Model evaluation: Evaluate the trained Keras model using a separate test set that was not used during training or validation. Calculate various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the model's performance. Visualize the model's performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves to understand its behavior across different thresholds.

Deployment and integration: Once the Keras model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed and integrated into an application or healthcare system. This allows healthcare professionals to upload retinal images and obtain predictions about the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy.

Remember to regularly update and improve the Keras model as new data becomes available to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.
